#Assignment 3

Using Transaction as a base class we abstract Check, Deposit, and
ServiceCharge. Inheriting from Transaction allows us to use polymorphism
and add all of these types of transactions to our transaction list.

Also have an account class as a base for the checking account class.
Can now use the GUI to generate lists of all types of transactions.
