# CSIS 139

Advanced Programming (Java)
Completed at Glendale Community College

This class went through and illustrated some topics that at the time were 
very much beyond my skill level. I think that I needed this increased level of
difficulty to learn as much as I did. When I think back to this class it was in my
mind the only reason for a long time that I felt I knew anything about programming.
This class is the reason why Java will forever have a place in my heart.
